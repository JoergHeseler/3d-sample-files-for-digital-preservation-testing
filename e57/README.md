All E57 files were validated using the [offical E57 validation tool](http://www.libe57.org/download.html). Unfortunately, it was not possible to create a minimal E57 file because both [MeshLab 2023.12](https://www.meshlab.net/#download) and a program based on the official [libE57Format](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format) library crashed when exporting without point data.
