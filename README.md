# ⚠️ Warning: Experimental Project ⚠️<br><br>3D Sample Files for Digital Preservation Testing

This repository provides sample 3D files in various “archive-friendly” formats and subversions for testing with digital preservation tools.

## Files

A an empty scene (**minimal**), a 3D model with very few vertices (**cube**) and a complex model with very many vertices (**kakadu**), where possible with textures, camera and lighting, are each provided in different archive-friendly formats. The file names consist of the object name, followed by the file format, the version or type, the changes made and finally the validation result.
