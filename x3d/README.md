All X3D files were validated with the [X3D validation tool](https://github.com/JoergHeseler/x3d-validator-for-archivematica). X3D files ending in `-valid` pass validation, while all other files fail.

More valid models and subversions can be found on the [official X3D website](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dResources.html#Examples). Below is just a brief overview of basic models in various X3D subversions:

- [Test Cube X3D 3.3 valid](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/Geospatial/Mars.x3d)
- [Test Cube X3D 3.2 valid](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/DistributedInteractiveSimulation/TestCube.x3d)
- [Teapot X3D 3.1 valid](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/CAD/CadTeapot.x3d)
- [Teapot X3D 3.0 valid](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/ExperimentalBinaryCompression/Teapot.x3d)
